# 🛡️ Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## 🎯 Objective

Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Tool: Wireshark v4.x (Free and Open Source)
- System: Windows 10
- Network Interface:Wi-Fi

---

## 📝 Steps Performed

1. ✅ Installed Wireshark on the system.
2. ✅ Selected the **Wi-Fi** interface and started packet capture.
3. ✅ Generated traffic by:
   - Visiting websites like `example.com`, `google.com`.
   - Running `ping` commands in the terminal.
4. ✅ Stopped the capture after 1–2 minutes.
5. ✅ Applied filters to narrow down the analysis:
   - `http`
   - `dns`
   - `tcp`
6. ✅ Identified multiple protocols in use.
7. ✅ Exported the captured packets as a `.pcapng` file.
8. ✅ Took screenshots at each step.
9. ✅ Created this documentation and uploaded to GitHub.


## 🔍 Protocols Identified

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| HTTP | Hypertext Transfer Protocol used for web communication. |
| DNS | Domain Name System used to resolve domain names to IPs. |
| TCP  | Transmission Control Protocol for reliable communication. |


## 🔑 Key Findings

1. **Captured Real-Time Network Traffic**
   Successfully captured live packets using Wireshark on the Wi-Fi interface during normal web browsing and ping commands.

2. **Identified Core Protocols**
   Detected and analyzed **HTTP**, **DNS**, and **TCP** protocols using display filters and packet inspection.

3. **Observed Unencrypted HTTP Data**
   HTTP packets showed plaintext request data, highlighting the risks of using non-HTTPS connections.

4. **Understood Network Behavior and Filtering**
   Gained hands-on experience with filtering, analyzing handshakes, DNS queries, and understanding how each protocol behaves during transmission.
